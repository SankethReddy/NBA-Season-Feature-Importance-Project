# NBA-Season-Feature-Importance-Project
Personal Project to see how different features contribute to an NBA team's winning percentage.

Jupyter Notebooks were used to create machine learning models for each NBA season to see how different features contribute to an NBA team's winning percentage in each respective season. The machine learning models were then dumped into their respective joblib files.

The Flask framework and the Dash library were used to create a UI web application for users to see the feature contributions in each season. This UI web application was created in the "app.py" file, and a snippet of the UI can be seen in the "Image of Dash Application UI.JPG" file. The "app.py" file was able to load the machine learning models from the joblib files.
